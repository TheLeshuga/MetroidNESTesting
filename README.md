# Content

Within this project, you can find the Test Plan, 3 Test Suites and many Test Cases to test different features, apart from bug reports . The videogame Metroid for the console Nintendo Entertainment System is put to the test with the test cases devised for this project. Even though not all the videogame features will be tested here, there will be tests for the title screen, main menu and the first screen of the game. This Test Plan is mainly for educational purposes to learn how to create Test Plans, Test Suites and Test Cases for videogames, as well as to practice it with a practical exercise. 

# Scope

- In Scope: Title Screen, Main menu and Game Scene Test Suites. Within the first one, there will be tests related to the functionality with the buttons and title animation. In the second Test Suite, there are tests regarding functionality, screen transition and animation. Lastly, for the Game Scene Test Suite, there are tests testing the functionality and some animations related to the main character's actions.              
- Out of Scope: Neither performance, accesibility, integration, regression, usabilty nor secutiry tests are included here, all of them are functional tests. Nonetheless, scope is reduced to only the Test Suites aforementioned. In addition, there will not be any test for the audio, other animations and some enemies behaviour.

# Environment and Tools

The hardware used is Nintendo Switch (ver 19.0.1) and the Software used is Nintendo Entertainment System Emulator (ver 6.9.0). Additionally, the tool used to devide the test cases is Microsoft Excel. Nonetheless, it is intented to also use JIRA or another similar software.
